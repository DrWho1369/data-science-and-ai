            <h2>Revision Notes</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>1. Introduction to Big Data</h3>
                <p><strong>Big Data:</strong> Large volumes of data generated rapidly from various sources.</p>
                <p>Examples include CERN's Large Hadron Collider (40TB/sec), RFID tags (30 billion/year), and Google search queries (40,000/sec).</p>
                
                <h3>2. Characteristics of Big Data (The 4 Vs)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Large amounts of data generated continuously.</li>
                    <li><strong>Velocity:</strong> High-speed data generation and processing (e.g., stock trading, fraud detection).</li>
                    <li><strong>Variety:</strong> Different types of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).</li>
                    <li><strong>Veracity:</strong> Data uncertainty, noise, and quality issues.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>3. Data Analytics</h3>
                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Transform raw data into actionable insights.</p>
                <p>Used in applications like Netflix recommendations, LinkedIn/Facebook social connections, and Google search optimization.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Statistical Learning</h3>
                <p>Focuses on modeling the relationship between input variables (X) and output variables (Y).</p>
                <p>Equation: Y = f(X) + ε, where ε is the irreducible error.</p>
                
                <h3>5. Types of Learning</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Input (X) and output (Y) are observed. Examples: Regression, classification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Only input (X) is observed. Examples: Clustering, PCA.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>WEEK 1 LABS - R Exercises</h2>
            <h3>Vectors</h3>
            <p>Create a vector <code>u</code> that has values -10 to 0. Here are different ways to do it:</p>
            <pre><code>
    u <- c(-10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0)
    u <- -10:0
    u <- seq(-10,0)
    u <- seq(from = -10, to = 0, by = 1)
    u <- seq(from = -10, to = 0, length.out = 11)
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>Basic Arithmetic in R</h3>
            <p>Perform arithmetic operations on vectors.</p>
            <pre><code>
    v <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
    w <- c(10,20,30,40,50)
    sum_vw <- v + w  # Element-wise addition
    prod_vw <- v * w  # Element-wise multiplication
            </code></pre>
            
            <h3>Data Frames</h3>
            <p>Create a data frame with sample data.</p>
            <pre><code>
    df <- data.frame(Name=c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"), Age=c(25, 30, 35), Score=c(80, 90, 85))
    print(df)
    summary(df)
            </code></pre>

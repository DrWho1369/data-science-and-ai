                <h3>1. Introduction to Basic Statistics</h3>
                <p>Statistics is the study of data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Key Statistical Measures</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The average value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value when sorted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The most frequently occurring value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Measures data spread.</li>
                    <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> Square root of variance.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>3. Probability and Bayes' Theorem</h3>
                <p><strong>Bayes' Theorem:</strong> Used to update probabilities based on new evidence.</p>
                <p>Formula:</p>
                <pre>P(H|E) = (P(E|H) * P(H)) / P(E)</pre>
                
                <h3>4. Statistical Distributions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Normal Distribution:</strong> Bell-shaped curve where data clusters around the mean.</li>
                    <li><strong>Binomial Distribution:</strong> Models binary outcomes (success/failure).</li>
                    <li><strong>Poisson Distribution:</strong> Counts events over a fixed period/space.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>1. Basic Descriptive Statistics</h3>
            <p>Define a numeric vector <code>x</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>
x <- c(10, 2, 15, 6, 4, 9, 12, 11, 3, 0, 12, 10, 9, 7, 11, 10, 8, 5, 10, 6)
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>Calculate fundamental statistics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Number of Observations:</strong></li>
                <pre><code>length(x)</code></pre>
                
                <li><strong>Sum of All Observations:</strong></li>
                <pre><code>sum(x)</code></pre>
                
                <li><strong>Mean (Average):</strong></li>
                <pre><code>mean(x)</code></pre>
                
                <li><strong>Median (Middle Value):</strong></li>
                <pre><code>median(x)</code></pre>
                
                <li><strong>Mode (Most Frequent Value):</strong></li>
                <pre><code>table(x)[which.max(table(x))]</code></pre>
                
                <li><strong>Five Number Summary:</strong></li>
                <pre><code>summary(x)</code></pre>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Generating Random Vectors & Computing Correlations</h3>
            <p>Generate a normally distributed vector <code>y</code> with the same mean as <code>x</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>y <- rnorm(20, mean(x), 1)</code></pre>
            
            <p>Compute the covariance and correlation between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>cov(x, y)
cor(x, y)</code></pre>
            
            <p>Set a seed for reproducibility and generate another random variable <code>z</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>set.seed(100)
z <- rnorm(20, 8, 1)
plot(x, z, main = "Scatter plot of x and z", xlab = "x", ylab = "z")</code></pre>
            
            <h3>3. Boxplot Visualization</h3>
            <p>Create a Boxplot for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to visualize distributions:</p>
            <pre><code>data <- data.frame(x, y)
boxplot(data, col = c("green", "orange"), main = "Boxplot for x and y")</code></pre>
